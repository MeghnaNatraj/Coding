* Depth is the length of the path from the root to the node (root - intermediate_node - node => 2 => number of links)
* Level (root) 0,1,2,....n (leaves)
* Height (length from root to deepest node)
* Height of a node (length from node to deepest node)

Level = Depth
A root node will have a depth of 0
A leaf node will have a height of 0

* Skew Trees: If every node in a tree has only 1 child; only left child (left skew tree).
* Binary Tree: If a tree has max. of 2 children.
    * Strict BT     Exactly 2 or no children
    * Full BT       Exactly 2 children and all leaf nodes are the same level.
    * Complete BT   Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and leaf nodes are to the left.

Empty tree is a valid BT
